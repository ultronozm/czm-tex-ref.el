#+title: czm-tex-ref.el: Interface for LaTeX labels/citations
#+author: Paul Nelson

* Overview
This package provides functions for inserting labels/references/citations in a LaTeX buffer.  For example, here's how it looks when I decide that I want to number some equation and refer to it:

#+attr_html: :width 800px
#+attr_latex: :width 800px
[[./img/gif.gif]]

This packages differs from the standard package for doing so, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/index.html][reftex]], in that

- label and reference features are combined into a single function,

- selection is previewed using [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]],

- it works in non-file buffers, where [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/index.html][reftex]] does not, and

- it is less feature-complete than reftex in a couple ways.

* Configuration
This package requires [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/auctex/Installation.html#Installation][AUCTeX]] and [[https://github.com/ultronozm/czm-tex-util.el][czm-tex-util.el]], so install those first.

Download this repository, install using =M-x package-install-file= (or package-vc-install, straight, elpaca, ...), and add something like the following to your [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InitFile][init file]]:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package czm-tex-ref
  :custom
  (czm-tex-ref-master-bib-file "~/doit/refs.bib")
  (czm-tex-ref-rearrange-bib-entries t)
  :bind
  (:map LaTeX-mode-map
	("C-c 9" . czm-tex-ref-label)
	("C-c 0" . czm-tex-ref-bib)))
#+end_src

Modify suitably:
- Replace the key binds with whatever you prefer.
- Replace "~/doit/refs.bib" with the path to the .bib file containing all your references.  If you don't use such a "master" .bib file, then delete that line; =czm-tex-ref= will then search through the first file encountered in any "\bibliography{...}" command found in your TeX buffer.
- The customization option =czm-tex-ref-rearrange-bib-entries t= means that =czm-tex-ref= will rearrange your .bib file by moving selected entries to the top, so that it becomes easy to repeatedly cite "popular" references.  If you wish to disable this behavior, change =t= to =nil=.
- If you work exclusively in file buffers and want to use reftex to select label captions, then add the following under =:custom=:
  #+begin_src elisp
   (czm-tex-ref-insert-label-function #'reftex-label)
  #+end_src
  Or customize this to whatever you'd like; the default option =czm-tex-ref-insert-label= inserts a time-stamped label in base 36, as in the GIF above.

To get the same behavior as depicted in the GIF above, you'll also want to install and set up vertico, and possibly orderless.  This affects how Emacs works in general (in a way that you may or may not like).  My config is roughly as follows:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package vertico
  :ensure t
  :demand
  :config
  (vertico-mode))

(use-package orderless
  :ensure t
  :demand
  :custom
  (completion-styles '(orderless basic)))
#+end_src

* Usage

** References and labels
The reader might be familiar with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/index.html][reftex]], which provides two basic functions for working with labels: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/Creating-Labels.html#Creating-Labels][reftex-label]] to insert labels, and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/Referencing-Labels.html#Referencing-Labels][reftex-reference]] to insert references to labels.

In =czm-tex-ref=, the label and reference features are combined into a single function, =czm-tex-ref-label=.  This uses [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]] to select a line in the current buffer that either contains a label, or where it makes sense to insert one.  In the latter case, a new label is inserted at the appropriate position.  In either case, a reference to the label is copied to the kill ring.

To illustrate, compare how you would insert a reference to an unlabelled equation that occurred at some earlier point in your document.  In [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/index.html][reftex]], you would
- navigate to the equation,
- run =refex-label= ~C-c (~ to insert a label,
- navigate back to where you want to reference it, and
- run  =reftex-reference= ~C-c )~ to select the equation that you just labelled.

In =czm-tex-ref=, you instead
- run =czm-tex-ref-label=,
- select the equation that you want to reference using [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]], and
- yank (=C-y=) the reference.

The latter workflow feels much quicker and more fluid to me.

** Citations

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/index.html][reftex]] provides one basic function for inserting citations, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/Creating-Citations.html#Creating-Citations][reftex-citation]].  The function =czm-tex-ref-bib= is analogous, but with two differences:
1. It uses [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]] to select the citation to insert.
2. It has been designed to work also in non-file buffers (e.g., [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Editing-Source-Code.html][indirect org-mode source blocks]]), and for this reason, is a bit less feature-complete than [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/Creating-Citations.html#Creating-Citations][reftex-citation]]:
   - It doesn't work with \bibitem entries.
   - It doesn't support multiple .bib files.

This isn't much of a problem for me, since I keep all my references in one .bib file.

* Tips and Tricks

** Candidate ordering in =czm-tex-ref-label=
When using =czm-tex-ref-label=, candidates are presented in a specific order: first the candidates from your current cursor position through the end of the document, followed by candidates from the beginning of the document up to your cursor position.

This means that:
- If you're in the middle of the document, candidates after your position appear first in the list, followed by candidates from the beginning up to your current position.
- When the selection menu appears, using =M->= (=end-of-buffer=) jumps to the end of the candidate list, which shows candidates from earlier in the document (those that appear just before your current position).

If you prefer to see candidates in document order (from beginning to end), the simplest approach is to place your cursor at the beginning of the document before invoking =czm-tex-ref-label=.

** Jumping to labels
By default, =czm-tex-ref-label= copies a reference to the selected label to the kill ring.  Sometimes, you might wish instead to jump to that label's definition.  You can achieve this using the [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark]] and [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/embark-consult.html][embark-consult]] packages, which allow you to perform context-sensitive actions on consult candidates.

First, install both packages and bind a key to =embark-act=, e.g.:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package embark
  :bind
  (("C-." . embark-act)
   ("M-." . embark-dwim)))

(use-package embark-consult)
#+end_src
Then, after invoking =czm-tex-ref-label= and navigating to the desired location in the candidates list, press ~C-.~ to invoke Embark, and then press ~RET~ to jump to the selected location (via the default Embark action, ~embark-consult-goto-location~).


* Related packages
There is a work in progress called [[https://github.com/karthink/consult-reftex][consult-reftex]] that provides a "two method" interface, closer to that of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/index.html][reftex]], for labels and references, also using [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]].
