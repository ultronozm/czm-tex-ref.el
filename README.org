#+title: czm-tex-ref.el: Interface for LaTeX labels/citations
#+author: Paul Nelson

* Overview
This package provides functions for inserting labels/references/citations in a LaTeX buffer.  For example, here's how it looks when I decide that I want to number some equation and refer to it:

#+attr_html: :width 800px
#+attr_latex: :width 800px
[[./img/gif.gif]]

This packages differs from the standard package for doing so, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/index.html][reftex]], in that

- label and reference features are combined into a single function,

- selection is previewed using [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]],

- it works in non-file buffers, where [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/index.html][reftex]] does not, and

- it is less feature-complete than reftex in a couple ways.

* Configuration
This package requires [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/auctex/Installation.html#Installation][AUCTeX]] and [[https://github.com/ultronozm/czm-tex-util.el][czm-tex-util.el]], so install those first.

Download this repository, install using =M-x package-install-file= (or package-vc-install, straight, elpaca, ...), and add something like the following to your [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InitFile][init file]]:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package czm-tex-ref
  :custom
  (czm-tex-ref-master-bib-file "~/doit/refs.bib")
  (czm-tex-ref-rearrange-bib-entries t)
  :bind
  (:map LaTeX-mode-map
	("C-c 9" . czm-tex-ref-label)
	("C-c 0" . czm-tex-ref-bib)))
#+end_src

Modify suitably:
- Replace the key binds with whatever you prefer.
- Replace "~/doit/refs.bib" with the path to the .bib file containing all your references.  If you don't use such a "master" .bib file, then delete that line; =czm-tex-ref= will then search through the first file encountered in any "\bibliography{...}" command found in your TeX buffer.
- The customization option =czm-tex-ref-rearrange-bib-entries t= means that =czm-tex-ref= will rearrange your .bib file by moving selected entries to the top, so that it becomes easy to repeatedly cite "popular" references.  If you wish to disable this behavior, change =t= to =nil=.
- If you work exclusively in file buffers and want to use reftex to select label captions, then add the following under =:custom=:
  #+begin_src elisp
   (czm-tex-ref-insert-label-function #'reftex-label)
  #+end_src
  Or customize this to whatever you'd like; the default option =czm-tex-ref-insert-label= inserts a time-stamped label in base 36, as in the GIF above.

* Usage

** References and labels
The reader might be familiar with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/index.html][reftex]], which provides two basic functions for working with labels: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/Creating-Labels.html#Creating-Labels][reftex-label]] to insert labels, and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/Referencing-Labels.html#Referencing-Labels][reftex-reference]] to insert references to labels.

In =czm-tex-ref=, the label and reference features are combined into a single function, =czm-tex-ref-label=.  This uses [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]] to select a line in the current buffer that either contains a label, or where it makes sense to insert one.  In the latter case, a new label is inserted at the appropriate position.  In either case, a reference to the label is copied to the kill ring.

To illustrate, compare how you would insert a reference to an unlabelled equation that occurred at some earlier point in your document.  In [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/index.html][reftex]], you would
- navigate to the equation,
- run =refex-label= ~C-c (~ to insert a label,
- navigate back to where you want to reference it, and
- run  =reftex-reference= ~C-c )~ to select the equation that you just labelled.

In =czm-tex-ref=, you instead
- run =czm-tex-ref-label=,
- select the equation that you want to reference using [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]], and
- yank (=C-y=) the reference.

The latter workflow feels much quicker and more fluid to me.

** Citations

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/index.html][reftex]] provides one basic function for inserting citations, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/Creating-Citations.html#Creating-Citations][reftex-citation]].  The function =czm-tex-ref-bib= is analogous, but with two differences:
1. It uses [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]] to select the citation to insert.
2. It has been designed to work also in non-file buffers (e.g., [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Editing-Source-Code.html][indirect org-mode source blocks]]), and for this reason, is a bit less feature-complete than [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/Creating-Citations.html#Creating-Citations][reftex-citation]]:
   - It doesn't work with \bibitem entries.
   - It doesn't support multiple .bib files.

This isn't much of a problem for me, since I keep all my references in one .bib file.

* Related packages
There is a work in progress called [[https://github.com/karthink/consult-reftex][consult-reftex]] that provides a "two method" interface, closer to that of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/reftex/index.html][reftex]], for labels and references, also using [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]].
